## üöÄ About This Project


**Vibe Type** is the first project in this series. It was developed using a "Vibe Coding" approach, where AI tools act as creative collaborators rather than just utilities. By leveraging AI for brainstorming, code snippets, and debugging, I was able to stay in a state of creative flow, focusing on the design, user experience, and the features that make the project feel exciting.

## üé® Features

- **Real-time WPM and Accuracy:** Track your typing speed and accuracy as you go.
- **Minimalist & "Vibe" Aesthetic:** A clean, dark-themed UI with subtle gradients and animations to create a calm, focused environment.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React and broken down into reusable components for maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** A seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Results Screen:** Get a summary of your performance after the timer ends.
